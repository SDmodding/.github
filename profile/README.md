## Modding
If you're interested in modding the game yourself, we provide enough repositories at this organization that will give you enough information to do mods by yourself.

The main repository you should check out is the: [SDK](https://github.com/SDmodding/SDK).

If you know how to reverse and use assembly debugger you can get yourself: [PDB](https://mega.nz/file/aThlWBSB#7hG3yh6G5hUjX2Dy-1Kqjqwq9gSAREJJeWqyeS1K_m8), this PDB has been in first steam version release and contain every single information about functions & variables names, structs, etc...
